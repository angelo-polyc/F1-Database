Remaining Issues
1. Velo data missing
The derivatives source shows 0 records. Either the backfill hasn't run or there's an ingestion issue.
2. Case sensitivity on asset IDs (partial)
bash# This works:
GET /api/time-series?asset=coin&metric=CLOSE&source=alphavantage  ✅

# But this returns empty (uppercase COIN):
GET /api/time-series?asset=COIN&metric=CLOSE&source=alphavantage  ❌
The case insensitivity works for metrics but may not be fully applied to asset IDs in time-series queries.
3. Error messages aren't helpful
When an asset isn't found, you get:
json{"asset": "bitconi", "metric": "PRICE", "count": 0, "data": []}
Better would be:
json{
  "error": "Asset 'bitconi' not found",
  "suggestions": ["bitcoin", "bitcoin-cash"],
  "did_you_mean": "bitcoin"
}
4. Guide still references TVL for chains
The guide says GET /api/time-series?asset=bitcoin&metric=TVL but chains use CHAIN_TVL. The auto-source selection picks DefiLlama correctly, but returns empty because Bitcoin doesn't have protocol-level TVL. Consider:

Auto-mapping TVL → CHAIN_TVL for chain-type entities, OR
Documenting more clearly that chains use CHAIN_* metrics

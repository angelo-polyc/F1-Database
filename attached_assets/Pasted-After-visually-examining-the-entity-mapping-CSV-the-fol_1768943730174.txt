After visually examining the entity mapping CSV, the following entities need to be combined (using the “name” column to specify which entities): ALT + AltLayer, Arkham + ARKM, Agora Dollar + AUSD, banana + banana-gun, Chiliz + Chiliz, DBR + deBridge, Fantom + Fantom, Gate + Gate.io, Gnosis + Gnosis, Helium Network + HNT, Metaplex + Metaplex, MOVE + Movement, Osmosis + Osmosis,  POL + Polygon, PUMP + pump.fun, Raydium + RAYDIUM, Ronin + RONIN, SCR + Scroll, SushiSwap + SUSHI, TON + Toncoin, TRU + TrueFi, Tether Gold + Tether Gold, LayerZero + LayerZero, Ronin + RONIN
 Then I want the following entities added  
- Artemis: Across (add it to the existing ‘Across’ entity in the entity mapping, referring to ‘Across’ in the ‘name’ column. Note that I will use this scheme for the rest of the query), Plasma (to be added to Plasma). For Across I want bridge volume as metric, for Plasma I want the same metrics that are being pulled from Artemis for Ethereum.
